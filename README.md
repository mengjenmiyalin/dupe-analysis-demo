Data Collection & Annotation

The dataset consists of 100 social media posts collected from multiple platforms.

Automated Coding: The motivation labels (Hedonic vs. Utilitarian) were generated using a custom LLM-based agent developed for this research.

Note: The source code for the automation agent (utilizing Groq/Llama-3 and strict schema enforcement) is currently private as it is part of an ongoing longitudinal study. It is available for review upon request by the admissions committee.
